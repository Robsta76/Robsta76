Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Rob

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I am a former healthcare professional. I have 3 years experience with a start-up that I co-founded with some friends. Unfortunately it did not go to plan. However, I learn't from the experience and I was really interested in the architecture and how software was built. Whilst working in healthcare, i completed a diploma in business management and then took the decision to change careers completely and become a web developer. I have a passion for technology and learning. 

For my projects, I created a rental site for fancy dress costumes. This was my first real creation, and i enjoyed the process so much. Here I learn't how to ideate through discussion and using Figma, work in a branch, push to master, work in a collaborative dev team, how to prioritise work, as well as front and back-end development that brought by learning to life. The aim of the application was to allow people to rent their facy dress costumes out to others, where they would otherwise have discarded them and increased pollution. It also saved renters time, money and hassle looking for a new fancy dress costume that someone else would have and did not need.


I then helped to create a mobile mindfulness app to help people deal with times of stress. This improved my coding skills even further. The aim of the app was to help people, for whom stress is harmful to their mental health. It combined exercise with a short walk in a green space, playing relaxing music or a meditative monologue to accompany them. It would also track their self-reported stress levels before and after and presented them on graphs, using Chartkick. We also created a user review and rating for the greenspaces and a diary entry that the user could keep and review either themselves or with their counsellor, if they used one to help their stress. It would allow users to note down their intimate feelings and triggers for their stress, which could then be reviewed so that they can become more aware of them and help reduce their stress and imporve their menta health. We completed this app in 8 days, which was quite stressful for the team, but we managed this through effective communication and understanding ðŸ‘¯.

I have come a long way in 9 weeks. At the start, i did not even know what a terminal was ðŸ¤”! Now I can code in Ruby on rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. I also know MySQL, postgreSQL, Figma, DB schema design. I am passionate about creating software and watching it grow, like your child, from ideation to full production. I am now fully on my journey to learn and develop into the best web developer i can be and help people bring their ideas and creations to life in a digital way. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy team sports in my spare time, playing cricket at a high level still ðŸ˜„. 

I am looking ðŸ”­ for an opportunity to work with a company that can nurture ðŸŒ± my talet for coding, for which i will pay them back with loyalty, hard work, leadership and management of both myself and others. 

I am keen to work on projects with others, to learn, achieve and grow. Please feel free to reach out ðŸ“« to me if you think we can help each other.
